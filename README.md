# Automate git flow

The main functionality of this repo is to create a chain reaction when we finish a feature and push it to the
main repository, which will then create a pull request for the review of the code, and when this pull request is approve
will be merge into the develop branch, same process will be repeated from develop to main.

This 3 main yml files execute the following functionality to make it possible:

workflow.yml ----------------- adds the version tag when there is a merge to main and deploys the page

pull_req_to_dev.yml ---------- when there is a push from the feature branch to develop creates a pull request

pull_req_to_main.yml --------- when there is a push or merge into develop creates a pull request to add code to main

Important

When working with a repository it is important to remember to keep our local repository up to date, so it is
advise to run a git pull command in our local branches after pushing code to this repository

Usage 

following the git workflow guidelines in order to add new features to our code we must work first
in the feature branch, after the feature is complete we can then push our changes to the feature branch
by using the following commands:

first we mast check if we are in the feature branch for that we use

git branch

then we must add the changes

git add .

after that we need to commit our changes adding something special to the end of the commit message, #minor or #major
depending on the importance of the feature

git commit -m "example commit #major"

and finally

git push

after that a pull request will be raise in the develop branch to add our changes, this pull request must be
approve in order to continue the workflow, if changes were approve then the workflow will continue, creating
a pull request to add our changes into the main branch, once this request is approve, the actions will deploy
the website.
